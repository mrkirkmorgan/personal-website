# My Personal Website

### Game Plan

This is a project that I've been developing on and off over the last few years and I feel as though 
its time to finally put the whole thing together. I'm going to keep the design rather simple and 
only have a navigational map and a descrpiton for each corresponding page. I'll establish a kind of
"versioning" system for the site and as versions are incremented, I'll add larger parts to the website.

I'm going to use the previous codebase as a starting point since the DNS and CNAME is already set up
as well as the certificate for the https:// connection. Not to mention the code is not that far along 
and it already consists of some of the basic components for the site.  

### Purpose

This website is simply meant to showcase my projects to the world. It's a window into what I work on 
and a way to market what I do to people who are curious. These projects primarily pretain to 
Computer Science and maybe some Finance projects, but I'd also like to use it as a way to showcase
some of my more astistically oriented projects. Perhaps this could eventually include things like 
music I write/make, photography I do, game development projects I work on, writing I work on, lesson
sets I work on, and maybe even a blog of sorts. Consider it a personal brand of sorts. I recoginze this
is a wide and varying set of subjects, but if I can find an intuitive way to string it all together,
then it could be a great resource for potential employers, collaborators, and curious passerbys. 

### Versions

##### Version 1.0

The first version I'm aiming to just be a static single-page website. It will consist of index.html which
will contain a section based page that will include a general landing area, an about section, a projects 
section, and a contact section. The reason I'm keeping the website so small in the beginning is because 
I don't yet have a lot of content to put in it. I have barely any projects to list and as of the moment, 
have no photography to put up, nothing to say for a blog, and no music. This way I can get a basic version
up for potential employers so that they can see at least I have pending projects and naturally a personal
website is also a cool addition to a portfolio. Finally, I don't have a lot of photos to use that are 
super high quality for a website.

### Tech to Be Used

I'm going to build this website as plainly and simply as I can. No confusing/fancy frameworks or crazy 
libraries. I'll stick to regular ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The only library I'll likely use is 
JQuery. I'll use a CDN for JQuery. The website will be hosted using GitHub pages and the DNS is managed
by NameCheap. The website uses a custom domain and it can be found at https://www.mrkirkmorgan.com.
