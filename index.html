                <p>
                    I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. During my time at Northeastern, I completed 3 cooperative education experiences (co-ops) working full-time for 6-7 months at 3 different companies. With each experience I sought to be involved in a different area of the business. This journey took me from working on the back-end, internal workings of a software platform, to developing client-facing web and mobile apps used directly by customers, to working in an entirely different industry as an analyst while also employing my passion and skills for technology to further the business and product.

                    My reasoning for seeking different positions in the software and finance industries coincides with my desire to understand how things work and what for. I believe it's important to not only understand how something works on a small scale, such as a small algorithm within a feature, but on a large scale too, such as the design of product that will revolutionize how something is done in an industry. It's this passion to understand the world around me that drives my desire to think outside the box and design/build software than can empower users to understand something in a way that couldn't be imagined before.
                        
                    In the future I plan to contribute to the tech industry from a project management role, leveraging my technological and business acumen with my passion for design and people. The possibility of being at the intersection of innovation, coordination, design, and planning as well as empowering others I work with is inspiriting to me.
                        
                    I am currently seeking software development opportunities, but am open to analyst roles that are more technological in nature. I'm willing to work anywhere for a great opportunity, but I'm partial to Boston, New York, or Philadelphia. If you know of a good opportunity, or just want to connect, please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email. Thank you!

                    Monitored a client portfolio worth roughly $237B AUM for losses

                    quick and accurate loss calculations. The program was written in 
                    Java and utilized Apache POI and Bloomberg APIs.

                    always been a passion of mine.
